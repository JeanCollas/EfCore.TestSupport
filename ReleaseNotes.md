## TODO

## 3.0.0

- Support both EF Core >=2.1 and EF Core >=3.0 by supporting NetStandard2.0 and NetStandard2.1.

## 2.0.0

- BREAKING CHANGE: By default EfSchemaCompare to only scan the tables that the entity classes map to - see issue #18.
- Improvement: EfSchemaCompare now has case insensitive table, schema, columns, etc. matching feature - see issues #9 and #19.
- BREAKING CHANGE: In EfSchemaCompare missing indexes are now referred to by "index constraint name" instead of "constraint name" - this was done as part of case insensitivity

- Improvement: CompareEfSql now recoginises unique indexes provided by constraints (rather than via the normal SQL Index statement)

## 1.7.0

- 
## 1.6.0
- Feature. Added new way to capture EF Core logging output, which is superior to the existing SetupLogging method. See EfCore.TestSupport Wiki page "Capture EF Core logging".
- Bug fix: SetupLogging is now marked as obsolete, but not removed so that existing unit tests don't break. 

## 1.5.2
- Bug fix: CompareEfSql no longer fails when there there isn't a primary key in a DbQuery - issue #8

## 1.3.1
- Package: EntityFrameworkCore libraies updated to version 2.0.2, and specific versions defined to match with SqlClient
